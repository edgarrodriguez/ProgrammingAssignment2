## Function makeCacheMatrix creates a special Matrix where the 
## inverse of the matrix is calculated the first time and then 
## cached to avoid extra processing time.

## Create special Matrix with cached inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Generate the inverse of a matrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
